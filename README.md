# Anime-Style 3D-to-2D Pipeline (Blender)

This repository tracks the roadmap and implementation notes for building a Blender-based pipeline that produces anime-style visuals from 3D assets using high-quality cel shading and line art.

- Start with `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the phased plan, milestones, and technical specs.
- This repo will evolve to include Blender node groups, shader presets, add-on scripts, and rendering automation once we move past discovery and prototyping.

## Quick Links
- Roadmap: `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- Shaders (planned): `blender/shaders/`
- Tools (planned): `tools/`

## Status
